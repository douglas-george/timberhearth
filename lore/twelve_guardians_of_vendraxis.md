# The Twelve Guardians of Vendraxis

## Overview
When Vendraxis, the Creeping Wither, was sealed into magical slumber, it took a sacrifice of immense magnitude: **twelve powerful wizards** gave up their human forms and identities to become **eternal animal guardians**, each tied to a different aspect of the imprisoning spell. Bound to nature and the land itself, these beings cannot return to their human lives without undoing the seal they uphold.

Each guardian retains **fragments of their former intelligence, memories, and magical abilities**, but they are now subject to the instincts, perceptions, and limitations of their animal forms. Over centuries, they’ve become woven into the landscape and folklore of Timberhearth.

## The Binding
Together, these twelve formed the **Circle of Severance**, casting the ritual that transformed themselves and created the conditions under which Vendraxis could be imprisoned. Each serves a symbolic and magical role, and their unity was essential to the binding’s stability.

Over time, many have fallen into obscurity—**forgotten by name and form**—but their presence lingers in the edges of the natural world.

> *"Should the twelve falter, or their pact be broken, the Wither shall rise again—root by root, breath by breath."*
