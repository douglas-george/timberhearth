# The Sealing of Vendraxis
#### A Fragment from the Tome of Hollowroot, Dated Year 1 of the Quiet Age

```"Let this be written in stone and spirit, that the story of our fall and our rising not be lost."```

Seven hundred twenty-two years ago, long before Timberhearth was carved from pine and stone, this land was known as Hollowroot Vale. It was a peaceful place—more peaceful, perhaps, than the world deserved. Its rivers ran sweet, its orchards bent low with fruit, and its people lived by kinship rather than coin. Children played in the meadows until the moon rose, and doors were rarely locked.

Among those people lived two souls of particular note. One was Elric Brightfeather, a scholar-clockmaker whose tower sang with soft bells and whose hands were always ink-stained. He was gentle, meticulous, and beloved by all who sought wisdom. The other was Kaelen of the Glades, a half-wild youth raised more by raccoons than men, with dirt on his cheeks and mischief in his smile. Kaelen stole only what others wasted, and gave away more than he kept.

When the change came, it came quietly.

A shadow fell across the eastern hills—not from the sun, but from the soil. Pumpkins, long a symbol of Hollowroot’s harvest joy, grew bloated and twisted. Their vines burrowed deep into the earth, coiling with strange intelligence. The seeds, once toasted and shared at festivals, began to carry… something else. Those who ate them found dreams not their own creeping into their minds. One child spoke in voices that weren't his. A man vanished, leaving behind only a patch of slick rot where he’d slept.

Elric was the first to suspect. Kaelen was the first to see. And both agreed—they could not face this evil alone.

The source, they learned, was no curse or blight, but a presence: Vendraxis, the Creeping Wither, an ancient being that fed not on blood, but on excess—on overgrowth, waste, and slothful magic left unattended. He was awakening, not arriving. His roots had always been beneath the world, but now they stirred.

Elric and Kaelen gathered others—leaders not of armies, but of life.

There was Mira Cinderglen, whose bakery hearth warmed half the Vale, and whose kindness was legend. She saw the rot in her flour and felt the wrongness in the dough.
Bramm the Forge-Hand, who spoke little but shaped sigils into steel, saw his anvil crack without cause.
Sister Aldith, veiled and soft-spoken, read the moon and dreamed of vines choking the stars.
Torren Wex, a carpenter with laughter in his lungs, found his ladders snapped by branches that grew overnight.
Even Garron Holt, the gruff old miner who hadn't come to a town feast in decades, appeared at the Hollowroot Tree, saying nothing but standing firm.

They met beneath that ancient tree, its roots deep and wise. There, Thalia Grimbrow, the boisterous tavern-keeper who once arm-wrestled a bear (or so she claimed), poured the circle's first cup of binding mead. She had seen her barrels sour without reason and knew something deep was wrong.

Thirteen came. Thirteen stood.

To banish Vendraxis was impossible. But to bind him—that could be done. At terrible cost.

The Covenant of Binding, an ancient rite known only through fragments of myth, required more than strength. It required the surrender of form. Each of them would give up their humanity, assuming the spirit of a creature aligned to their essence. They would become the Guardians Eternal, neither beast nor mortal, watching over the prison for as long as the seal held.

Elric, keeper of time and thought, became Whistlewing, the great owl.
Kaelen, the trickster with a loyal heart, took the form of Ringtail, the raccoon.
Mira’s warmth burned into Embermane, the fox whose fire never dies.
Bramm became Stoneback, the unyielding badger.
Sister Aldith took the wings of Mothshade, drifting between waking and dream.
Torren became Hearthgnaw, the bold and acrobatic squirrel.
Garron descended into the soil as Gnarltooth, the mole.
Thalia, strong and joyous, transformed into Bramblegut, the great boar—her laughter now an echo through the roots.
Others—Mistpelt the deer, Glintleap the frog, Flicker the mouse, Skyflutter the butterfly, and Glowfern the cat—each lent their spirit to the seal.

Together, they formed a living ward. At the center of the ritual stood the pumpkin, twisted and corrupted. It became both key and lock. To anchor the spell, a tradition was seeded: never eat pumpkin seeds. For within each one, a fragment of Vendraxis still slumbered. The act of eating one would be to invite him back, piece by piece.

The Vale’s people were told this truth, but as generations passed, the memory dulled. Warnings became folklore. Folklore became superstition. And superstition became jokes. Yet the tradition held.

To this day, no one in Timberhearth eats pumpkin seeds. Ask them why, and each will give a different reason.
“They cause warts.”
“They attract goblins.”
“My uncle ate one and turned orange.”

But the truth sleeps beneath their feet.

The Guardians endured. Hidden in feather, fur, and fang, they watched. They waited.
But the world forgets. And when the world forgets, the seal grows thin.

“Forget not the price once paid. Forget not the forms now taken. Forget not the seeds that sleep in shadow.”
