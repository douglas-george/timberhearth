## Chapter One: The Town Where No One Ate Pumpkin Seeds

In the village of Timberhearth, nestled between the whispering West Woods and the tumbling Willow River, there was a clock tower that hooted like an owl every night at midnight.

Nobody thought this was strange — not even Mrs. Thistlepot, who was famous for thinking most things were strange. She thought Mr. Wimple’s crooked hat was strange. She thought the way cats sometimes stared at walls, as if listening to a second conversation, was strange. But the clock tower? That was simply how Timberhearth kept time.

Gabriel Thatcher had grown up with that midnight hoot the way other boys grew up with church bells. It slipped into his dreams and showed up again in the quiet cracks of the day. And now that he had turned sixteen — before the end-of-July cutoff, as the elders liked to say, as if July itself kept a ledger — he found himself listening differently.

As if the tower might be calling his name in a language made of feathers.

Timberhearth was the sort of place where the peculiar wore a familiar face, and ordinary things carried the weight of old warnings. A hooting clock tower. A river that sounded like gossip. And once a year, a guardian owl named Whistlewing, who came down to speak with the village’s newest sixteen-year-olds — the ones who’d had the good sense (or bad luck) to be born early enough in the year.

Also: Pumpkin seeds.

No one wrote the pumpkin-seed ban on a sign. No one dragged you to the stocks for chewing one. But in Timberhearth it lived in raised eyebrows, in sharp little coughs from passing aunties, and in the way a child could suddenly remember their hands belonged in their pockets.

The elders still grumbled about it — and yes, most people laughed when they repeated the reasons. Long ago, people said eating even a single seed could bring terrible consequences. Some claimed it would make your hair sprout vines. Others swore it might summon raccoons — hundreds of them — armed with tiny wooden swords.

It was only superstition.

A very strong superstition.

Mossel the caretaker did not laugh.

“Pumpkin seeds make your hair grow vines,” he still said, with a grave shake of his head. Mossel spent most of his days tending the flowerbeds in the village square and fixing squeaky gates, and he believed in following the old ways.

“Rubbish,” said Mrs. Thistlepot. “Everyone knows they summon raccoons. Hundreds of them. Possibly thousands.”

The children of Timberhearth, of course, had their own ideas. Some dared each other to crack open pumpkin seeds behind the bakery at night, though no one ever actually ate one. Not even Orrin Thatcher, who had once held one in his palm for a whole afternoon, staring at it as if it might whisper secrets.

Orrin’s older brother, Gabriel, didn’t care about seeds at all — at least, not in the way the others did.

Gabriel was far too busy dreaming of magic.

Not the grand sort of magic you read about in books with dragons and lightning bolts. He wanted small, useful spells — the kind that could light a lantern, dry wet socks, or make bread rise perfectly every time. The kind that could make a person feel… chosen.

In a town where everyone knew whose roof leaked and whose boots had been patched twice, Gabriel had grown up knowing exactly how poor his family was. He didn’t talk about it. He just carried it, quietly, like a stone in his pocket. A little magic, he thought, might be something no one could take from him.

His best friend, Jessica Willowglen, thought this was entirely sensible.

Jessica’s family owned the Willowglen Bakery, which filled the whole village square with the scent of honey rolls and sourdough loaves every morning. If there was one thing Jessica believed in, it was the quiet power of a good, warm loaf of bread — the way it could soften a frown, fix a sour mood, and make even Mossel pause mid-scold.

The two of them had been friends for as long as anyone could remember. And now, because they had both turned sixteen before the end of July, they were on this year’s list.

Soon, the invitation would come.

Nobody delivered it by hand. Timberhearth didn’t do things that plainly. The elders would begin to “happen” to mention the clock tower in the same breath as your name. Mossel would sweep the cobblestones a little more pointedly in your direction. And someone — always someone — would say, with a look that tried very hard to be casual, “Well. Whistlewing will be wanting a word.”

Whistlewing was no ordinary owl, of course.

He lived at the very top of the clock tower, in a roost filled with feathers and glowing stones, and only came down once a year to speak with the village’s newest sixteen-year-olds. It was a great honor, but also a great mystery, for no one ever spoke of what Whistlewing said to them.

Some returned from the meeting beaming with pride. Others looked thoughtful, or even a little worried.

But they never told.

And now it was Gabriel and Jessica’s turn.

“Do you think he’ll like us?” Jessica asked one warm September morning as they sat by the Willow River. She had her sleeves rolled up and her apron smudged with flour, as if the bakery had tried to keep her and failed.

Between her fingers she worried a puff of dandelion seeds she’d plucked from the riverbank. She didn’t blow them — not yet. She just turned the pale fluff thoughtfully, as if each seed were a tiny idea waiting for a place to land.

“I think,” Gabriel said, skipping a flat stone across the water, “that he’ll like you just fine. You’re good at baking, you’re kind to cats, and you didn’t run away screaming when that raccoon tried to steal your shoe last week.”

Jessica laughed. “That raccoon did look rather determined.”

They both went quiet for a moment, listening to the river babble over the stones. A dragonfly zipped past, wings flashing in the sunlight like a sliver of blue glass.

“Do you think he gives everyone a gift?” Gabriel asked softly.

Jessica looked at him. “What sort of gift?”

He shrugged, and tried to make it casual. “A little magic. Or maybe… advice. Something important. You know.”

Jessica’s brow furrowed the way it always did when she was measuring something invisible. At last she lifted the dandelion puff, took a breath, and blew.

The seeds drifted over the river like tiny parachutes.

“If he does give us something,” she said, watching them go, “I hope it’s not pumpkin seeds.”

Gabriel grinned. “People don’t really believe all that anymore.”

“Maybe not,” Jessica said. “But if I woke up with vines for hair, I’d be very cross with you.”

Gabriel smiled and skipped another stone. “Fair enough.”

They didn’t know it yet — not really — but this would be the last quiet morning they’d spend by the Willow River for quite some time.

Because Timberhearth was beginning to shift in small ways, the way a pie crust shifts before it splits. A breeze worried at the pumpkin vines on the edge of town. Somewhere, a shutter that always latched decided not to.

And in the village square, right by the well where the vines were always green and smug about it, one trailing tendril had gone withered and brown — out of place enough that even the cats gave it a wide berth.

Two nights ago, the clock tower’s midnight hoot had arrived a heartbeat early, as if the tower had startled itself awake.

But that’s getting ahead of the story.

For now, let’s leave them by the river, wondering about owls and pumpkin seeds, and follow the wind as it slips through the village square — past the bakery cats, past the caretaker sweeping the cobblestones, and up, up, up the spiral stairs of the clock tower.

To where Whistlewing the owl is waiting.
