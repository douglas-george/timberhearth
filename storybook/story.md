## Chapter One: The Town Where No One Ate Pumpkin Seeds

In the village of Timberhearth, nestled between the whispering West Woods and the tumbling Willow River, there was a clock tower that hooted like an owl every night at midnight.

Nobody thought this was strange — not even Mrs. Thistlepot, who was famous for thinking most things were strange. She thought Mr. Wimple’s crooked hat was strange. She thought the way cats sometimes stared at walls, as if listening to a second conversation, was strange. But the clock tower? That was simply how Timberhearth kept time.

Gabriel Thatcher had grown up with that midnight hoot the way other boys grew up with church bells. It slipped into his dreams and showed up again in the quiet cracks of the day. And now that he had turned sixteen — before the end-of-July cutoff, as the elders liked to say, as if July itself kept a ledger — he found himself listening differently.

As if the tower might be calling his name in a language made of feathers.

Timberhearth was the sort of place where the peculiar wore a familiar face, and ordinary things carried the weight of old warnings. A hooting clock tower. A river that sounded like gossip. And once a year, a guardian owl named Whistlewing, who came down to speak with the village’s newest sixteen-year-olds — the ones who’d had the good sense (or bad luck) to be born early enough in the year.

Also: Pumpkin seeds.

No one wrote the pumpkin-seed ban on a sign. No one dragged you to the stocks for chewing one. But in Timberhearth it lived in raised eyebrows, in sharp little coughs from passing aunties, and in the way a child could suddenly remember their hands belonged in their pockets.

The elders still grumbled about it — and yes, most people laughed when they repeated the reasons. Long ago, people said eating even a single seed could bring terrible consequences. Some claimed it would make your hair sprout vines. Others swore it might summon raccoons — hundreds of them — armed with tiny wooden swords.

It was only superstition.

A very strong superstition.

Mossel the caretaker did not laugh.

“Pumpkin seeds make your hair grow vines,” he still said, with a grave shake of his head. Mossel spent most of his days tending the flowerbeds in the village square and fixing squeaky gates, and he believed in following the old ways.

“Rubbish,” said Mrs. Thistlepot. “Everyone knows they summon raccoons. Hundreds of them. Possibly thousands.”

The children of Timberhearth, of course, had their own ideas. Some dared each other to crack open pumpkin seeds behind the bakery at night, though no one ever actually ate one. Not even Orrin Thatcher, who had once held one in his palm for a whole afternoon, staring at it as if it might whisper secrets.

Orrin’s older brother, Gabriel, didn’t care about seeds at all — at least, not in the way the others did.

Gabriel was far too busy dreaming of magic.

Not the grand sort of magic you read about in books with dragons and lightning bolts. He wanted small, useful spells — the kind that could light a lantern, dry wet socks, or make bread rise perfectly every time. The kind that could make a person feel… chosen.

In a town where everyone knew whose roof leaked and whose boots had been patched twice, Gabriel had grown up knowing exactly how poor his family was. He didn’t talk about it. He just carried it, quietly, like a stone in his pocket. A little magic, he thought, might be something no one could take from him.

His best friend, Jessica Willowglen, thought this was entirely sensible.

Jessica’s family owned the Willowglen Bakery, which filled the whole village square with the scent of honey rolls and sourdough loaves every morning. If there was one thing Jessica believed in, it was the quiet power of a good, warm loaf of bread — the way it could soften a frown, fix a sour mood, and make even Mossel pause mid-scold.

The two of them had been friends for as long as anyone could remember. And now, because they had both turned sixteen before the end of July, they were on this year’s list.

Soon, the invitation would come.

Nobody delivered it by hand. Timberhearth didn’t do things that plainly. The elders would begin to “happen” to mention the clock tower in the same breath as your name. Mossel would sweep the cobblestones a little more pointedly in your direction. And someone — always someone — would say, with a look that tried very hard to be casual, “Well. Whistlewing will be wanting a word.”

Whistlewing was no ordinary owl, of course.

He lived at the very top of the clock tower, in a roost filled with feathers and glowing stones, and only came down once a year to speak with the village’s newest sixteen-year-olds. It was a great honor, but also a great mystery, for no one ever spoke of what Whistlewing said to them.

Some returned from the meeting beaming with pride. Others looked thoughtful, or even a little worried.

But they never told.

And now it was Gabriel and Jessica’s turn.

“Do you think he’ll like us?” Jessica asked one warm September morning as they sat by the Willow River. She had her sleeves rolled up and her apron smudged with flour, as if the bakery had tried to keep her and failed.

Between her fingers she worried a puff of dandelion seeds she’d plucked from the riverbank. She didn’t blow them — not yet. She just turned the pale fluff thoughtfully, as if each seed were a tiny idea waiting for a place to land.

“I think,” Gabriel said, skipping a flat stone across the water, “that he’ll like you just fine. You’re good at baking, you’re kind to cats, and you didn’t run away screaming when that raccoon tried to steal your shoe last week.”

Jessica laughed. “That raccoon did look rather determined.”

They both went quiet for a moment, listening to the river babble over the stones. A dragonfly zipped past, wings flashing in the sunlight like a sliver of blue glass.

“Do you think he gives everyone a gift?” Gabriel asked softly.

Jessica looked at him. “What sort of gift?”

He shrugged, and tried to make it casual. “A little magic. Or maybe… advice. Something important. You know.”

Jessica’s brow furrowed the way it always did when she was measuring something invisible. At last she lifted the dandelion puff, took a breath, and blew.

The seeds drifted over the river like tiny parachutes.

“If he does give us something,” she said, watching them go, “I hope it’s not pumpkin seeds.”

Gabriel grinned. “People don’t really believe all that anymore.”

“Maybe not,” Jessica said. “But if I woke up with vines for hair, I’d be very cross with you.”

Gabriel smiled and skipped another stone. “Fair enough.”

They didn’t know it yet — not really — but this would be the last quiet morning they’d spend by the Willow River for quite some time.

Because Timberhearth was beginning to shift in small ways, the way a pie crust shifts before it splits. A breeze worried at the pumpkin vines on the edge of town. Somewhere, a shutter that always latched decided not to.

And in the village square, right by the well where the vines were always green and smug about it, one trailing tendril had gone withered and brown — out of place enough that even the cats gave it a wide berth.

Two nights ago, the clock tower’s midnight hoot had arrived a heartbeat early, as if the tower had startled itself awake.

But that’s getting ahead of the story.

For now, let’s leave them by the river, wondering about owls and pumpkin seeds, and follow the wind as it slips through the village square — past the bakery cats, past the caretaker sweeping the cobblestones, and up, up, up the spiral stairs of the clock tower.

To where Whistlewing the owl is waiting.


## Chapter Two: Whistlewing and the Clock Tower

At the very top of Timberhearth’s clock tower, there was a nest.

It was not the sort of nest you might find in an ordinary tree. This nest was a grand tangle of feathers, moss, and little treasures collected over the years. There were smooth river stones that caught the morning light, bits of copper wire from the tinkers’ shop, and a tiny glass bell that jingled every time the wind shifted.

And in the middle of this curious nest sat Whistlewing, the owl.

He was an impressive sight—broad-winged, silver-feathered, and with eyes like molten gold. If you looked very carefully, you might notice faint symbols swirling in those eyes: ancient runes that spoke of wisdom too old to be written down.

But at that moment, Whistlewing wasn’t thinking about runes or wisdom.

He was thinking about the two young villagers who would soon climb the spiral stairs to meet him.

”Sixteen already,” he murmured, fluffing his feathers. “It feels like only yesterday Jessica Willowglen was toddling after bakery cats and Gabriel Thatcher was falling headfirst into flowerpots.”

The gargoyle didn’t answer.

Of course it didn’t. It was just a stone figure, perched in the shadows of the roost with moss creeping over its wings and a cracked smile on its face. Most people assumed it was part of the clock tower’s architecture. 

Most people were right.

But Whistlewing talked to it anyway.

”It’s a serious thing, choosing a gift,” he said, pacing along the edge of the nest. “Not every sixteen-year-old is ready for one.”

The gargoyle watched silently, as it had for decades.

”You disagree, I can tell,” Whistlewing went on. “You think I fret too much. Well, maybe I do. But it’s in my nature to fret. That’s why I get things done.”

He gave a soft hoot and stretched his wings wide. Dust motes swirled in the amber light of the glowing stones embedded in the tower walls. Below, the town square was coming alive: shopkeepers opening shutters, children chasing each other with wooden swords, and Mossel the caretaker sweeping the cobblestones in slow, thoughtful arcs.

”Jessica and Gabriel,” Whistlewing murmured. “So alike, and yet so different.”

Jessica was steady and thoughtful. She carried warmth in her hands and kindness in her eyes. But there was a spark of wildness in her too, like the scent of rain on stone.

Gabriel… Gabriel had that restless energy Whistlewing saw now and then in the Thatchers. Clever fingers, quick eyes, and a mind always chasing some new idea. He wanted magic, but Whistlewing suspected he didn’t yet know what that truly meant.

”Perhaps,” Whistlewing said softly, “it’s time for Timberhearth to remember what magic costs.”

The gargoyle stared, still and silent.

Whistlewing ruffled his feathers. ”Don’t give me that look. I know what you’re thinking.”

He let out a low hoot that echoed through the clock tower’s spiraling stairwell.

“They’ll be here soon,” he said.



## Chapter Three: The Night of Voices


Every autumn in Timberhearth, the Night of Voices brought the whole village together beneath the clock tower.

It was a night for lanterns and laughter, music and honey cakes. A night for remembering old stories and telling new ones. And, most importantly, a night for the sixteen-year-olds to climb the tower and speak with Whistlewing, the guardian owl.

Jessica and Gabriel had looked forward to this night for as long as they could remember.

The village square shimmered in the glow of a hundred lanterns, swaying gently from poles and eaves. Some were shaped like moons and stars. Others, simpler ones, flickered behind colored paper. The air smelled of cinnamon, roasted chestnuts, and bread still warm from the oven.

Jessica’s mother stood behind the bakery stall, handing out steaming buns and honey twists. She looked serene as always, though Jessica had noticed her hands kneading dough faster than usual that morning.

”Take these to the square,” her mother had said earlier, pressing a basket of rolls into her arms. “But no lingering. Tonight is your night, Jessica.”

And so here she was, lingering all the same.

”Two more meat pies,” Gabriel said, appearing at her side. He had crumbs on his tunic and a satisfied grin. “Don’t look at me like that. I’m storing up energy for the climb.”

Jessica rolled her eyes but handed him a napkin anyway.

As the last streaks of sunset melted into twilight, the village bell tolled eight times. The crowd hushed. Lanterns bobbed as heads turned toward the steps of the clock tower, where Mayor Bristow Fenwick stood, resplendent in his burgundy coat and gold-trimmed sash.

He raised a hand for silence, though his kind eyes crinkled as if he were struggling not to smile.

”Good folk of Timberhearth,” the mayor began, his voice deep and steady, “tonight we gather for the Night of Voices—a tradition as old as the clock tower itself.

”This is the hour when our young ones take their first steps toward adulthood, ascending to seek the wisdom of Whistlewing, our guardian and guide. As they climb, may they carry with them the love and hopes of all who came before.”

There was a ripple of murmurs and nods from the crowd.

“Let them go forth with courage,” Mayor Fenwick continued, ”for though the climb is steep, the view from the top will guide their hearts.”

He spread his arms toward the gathered sixteen-year-olds. “And so it begins.”

There were four young villagers this year, standing in a quiet line with lanterns in hand. Jessica and Gabriel were among them.

Each family had gathered earlier in the day to bestow a gift upon their child: a small pouch of coins—coalmarks, the town’s currency. It was a tradition meant to mark their independence and to help them begin their chosen trade or craft.

Jessica’s parents had pressed 250 coalmarks into her palm that morning.

”Spend it wisely,” her mother had said. “But not too wisely. Life needs a little sweetness.”

Gabriel’s family had given him 65 coalmarks, tied neatly in a cloth bundle.

”Don’t blow it all on twine and clock parts,” his father had warned, though there was a twinkle in his eye.

Then came the first voice—low, deep, and resonant.

“Elaina Tussle.”

The sound seemed to rise not from the mayor’s lips but from the very stones of the clock tower itself. It carried across the square like a breeze through autumn leaves.

Elaina stepped forward, clutching her lantern tight, and disappeared into the cool darkness of the tower.

The door creaked shut.

Minutes passed. The crowd murmured softly to one another, eyes darting to the high tower windows, where faint light flickered.

Then the voice came again.

”Rowan Fairbairn.”

Rowan grinned nervously, took a deep breath, and walked forward to mount the steps. The door shut behind him too.

Jessica shifted from foot to foot. Gabriel rubbed the back of his neck.

They were next.

But instead of calling a single name, the voice came again—louder this time, and stranger.

“Gabriel Thatcher. Jessica Willowglen.”

The crowd stirred. Someone whispered, ”Together?”

“That’s never happened before,” said another.

Mossel the caretaker frowned but said nothing. Mayor Fenwick’s brow furrowed ever so slightly, though his voice remained calm as he gestured to them.

”You’re called,” he said softly.

Jessica’s stomach fluttered.

Gabriel gave her a crooked grin. “Ready?” he whispered.

”No,” Jessica whispered back.

“Good,” he said. ”Neither am I.”

The crowd parted, and someone handed each of them a lantern—a simple one, made of paper and twine.

The oak door creaked open. Cool air drifted out, carrying the scent of old stone and something feathered.

“Stay close,” Jessica said as they stepped inside.

”Don’t worry,” Gabriel replied. “What’s the worst that could happen? Falling down five flights of stairs?”

”That,” Jessica said. “That is exactly the worst.”

The door shut behind them with a soft thud.

The sound of the festival faded, replaced by their own footsteps on the worn stone steps and the flicker of lantern light dancing on the walls.

They climbed.

And climbed.

The air grew warmer. The stairs seemed endless, circling upward like the coil of a snail’s shell. On the walls, they saw faint carvings—stars, feathers, and shapes that seemed to shift if you looked too long.

A deep hoot echoed from far above.

Jessica tightened her grip on her lantern.

”Almost there,” Gabriel murmured.

They reached a small landing. The final staircase loomed ahead, steeper than the rest.

Jessica took a deep breath.

“Ready?” Gabriel asked.

”No.”

“Me neither,” Gabriel said. ”Let’s go anyway.”

And together, they started up the last flight.



## Chapter Four: The Owl in the Clock Tower


The stairs ended at a wooden door, its surface worn smooth by countless hands over countless years.

Jessica hesitated, lantern trembling in her grip. Gabriel stood beside her, his free hand resting lightly on the latch.

“Shall I knock?” he whispered.

Before she could answer, a low voice drifted from beyond the door—soft and deep, like the rustle of feathers.

”No need.”

The door creaked open on its own.

Warm light spilled out, golden and flickering. The air inside was thick with the scent of cedar and something faintly sweet—like honey warmed over a fire.

The room was circular, its stone walls carved with swirling patterns of stars and feathers. At the center, atop a great tangled nest of moss and river reeds, sat Whistlewing.

He was larger than Jessica had imagined—his silver feathers shimmering faintly, as if each one held a sliver of moonlight. His great golden eyes fixed on them, ancient and unblinking.

“Come closer,” he said.

Jessica and Gabriel stepped forward. Their lanterns sputtered and dimmed, then went out entirely. Yet the room did not darken; light seemed to emanate from the very air.

”You’ve climbed far to reach me,” Whistlewing said, his voice like a song sung in a deep cavern. “But your journey has only begun.”

Jessica swallowed hard. ”Why… why did you call us together?”

A faint sound, almost like a chuckle, rumbled in Whistlewing’s chest.

“Because your paths are intertwined,” he said simply. ”Two threads woven into a single tapestry. To meet one is to meet the other.”

Gabriel shifted uncomfortably. “Does that mean… we’re the same?”

”No,” Whistlewing replied, his eyes gleaming. “It means you are different in ways that matter—and alike in ways that matter more.”

The owl stretched his wings, and a hush fell over the room. From within his feathers, he drew forth two small objects: one dark, one pale.

”Jessica Willowglen,” Whistlewing intoned, “you carry within you the spark of nature. To you, I give this.”

He extended his claw. Resting there was a leaf of stone, delicate and lace-like, as if it had been carved by water and time.

Jessica reached out with trembling hands. The moment her fingers brushed the stone, warmth bloomed in her chest—not a heat of fire, but a gentle, steady glow, like sunlight filtering through leaves.

”This will remind you,” Whistlewing said softly, “that even the smallest seed holds the power to grow, to heal, to endure.”

Jessica clutched the stone leaf to her heart.

”Gabriel Thatcher,” Whistlewing continued, turning his gaze on the boy. “You are quick of mind and restless of heart. To you, I give this.”

He revealed a dark crystal, shaped like a heart and faintly luminous, as though lit from within.

Gabriel stared. ”What… what does it do?”

“That,” said Whistlewing, ”is for you to discover. But know this: it holds the power to bring people together. And yet, before you can use it well, you must first learn to gather the pieces of yourself.”

Gabriel hesitated, then took the crystal. The moment his fingers closed around it, he felt a faint hum, like the echo of distant voices—soft, comforting, and impossibly far away.

Whistlewing settled his feathers and regarded them both with a deeper gravity.

“There is more I must say,” he murmured. ”Lately I have seen signs—flickers in the air, shadows where none should be, the faint scent of magic curling through the square. Small things, but troubling.

“I would investigate them myself, but there are places where my wings cannot carry me. And so I ask you: in the days ahead, walk the streets of Timberhearth. Listen. Watch. Follow the whispers. You may be the first to notice what others cannot.”

Jessica and Gabriel exchanged glances.

”You want us to… to find what’s wrong?” Jessica asked.

“Yes,” Whistlewing said. ”Whatever it is, it hides itself well. But you are young. New eyes see differently. And perhaps that will be enough.”

The owl’s golden gaze softened.

“Return to me in seven days. At sunset, climb these stairs again. Bring what you have learned—whether it is much or little. What you uncover may shape the days to come.”

Jessica opened her mouth to speak—then stopped. There were so many questions, but the words tangled on her tongue.

Whistlewing gave a soft hoot. ”In time, the answers will come. But tonight is for beginnings.”

The door behind them swung open silently.

Jessica and Gabriel turned, clutching their gifts.

“Ready?” Gabriel whispered as they stepped toward the stairs.

Jessica managed a small smile. ”No.”

“Good,” Gabriel said. ”Neither am I.”

And together, they began the long descent.




## Chapter Five: Mossel and the Stump


Mossel Ironhand didn’t trust the clock tower.

It had been exactly seven days since the Night of Voices—the same number Whistlewing had spoken. His summons came as the clock tower chimed noon, carried by rumor more than voice. The villagers said the owl had stirred again, feathers shining at the windows, waiting.

He trusted cobblestones and broom bristles. He trusted shutters that creaked in the wind and flowerbeds that needed weeding. But he didn’t trust old magic—especially the kind that lived at the top of spiraling stairs and spoke with the voice of an owl.

So when Jessica Willowglen and Gabriel Thatcher asked to climb the tower a week ago, Mossel had planted himself squarely in their path.

“Not yet,” he had told them. ”Sixteen or not, you’re still green as spring grass. There’s a stump in the east meadow that’s been waiting three summers to be cleared. You help me with that first. Then I’ll believe you’re ready for Whistlewing’s riddles.”

Jessica had looked at him with steady eyes. Gabriel had sighed dramatically. But in the end, they had promised.

And Mossel, against his better judgment, had let them ascend.

Now, seven days later, Mossel swept the cobblestones with deliberate strokes, the memory still tugging at him.

“They’re still just children,” he muttered to himself.

Of course, it wasn’t strictly true anymore. Sixteen was the threshold for many things in Timberhearth—apprenticeships, voting at the harvest council, even the right to climb the tower during the Night of Voices.

But sixteen didn’t make you wise.

He heard footsteps approaching and looked up.

Jessica and Gabriel were crossing the square, lanterns in hand.

Jessica’s expression was calm and determined. Gabriel’s was restless, like a cat about to leap.

”They’re coming again,” Mossel murmured, resting both hands on his broom.

When the two reached him, he gave them a long, appraising look.

“You promised to help with the stump,” he said.

”And we did,” Jessica replied evenly. “The meadow’s clear.”

”It was a huge stump,” Gabriel added, rubbing his shoulder for effect. “I’m still sore.”

”Hmph.” Mossel’s frown softened—just slightly. “So you kept your word. That’s something, at least.”

He glanced toward the clock tower. Its great oak door loomed dark against the lantern glow.

”You’re climbing again?” he asked.

“Whistlewing called us back,” Jessica said.

”That owl’s been odd lately,” Mossel muttered. “Calling you two up together, asking for you again… none of this feels right.”

Gabriel tilted his head. ”Do you want to stop us?”

“No,” Mossel said after a pause. ”If Whistlewing’s chosen you, that’s his business. But mind this—some doors don’t open the same way twice.”

Jessica nodded. “We’ll be careful.”

”You’d better be,” Mossel said gruffly. “If you come back down with feathers in your hair and stars in your eyes, don’t say I didn’t warn you.”

He stepped aside as they passed.

The oak door creaked open before they even touched it, spilling warm, golden light across the square. The faint scent of feathers and cedar drifted out.

Jessica and Gabriel stepped inside, and the door swung shut behind them.

Mossel stood still in the quiet square, his broom balanced like a staff in his hand.

”They’re still just children,” he murmured again.

And though he’d swept every leaf and pebble from the square, he couldn’t shake the feeling that something unseen still lingered.



## Chapter Six: Shadows and Sparks


The second climb to Whistlewing’s roost felt different.

The first time, the tower had hummed with mystery—like a sealed letter waiting to be opened. This time, the air felt heavier, more watchful, as if the tower already knew what they were coming to ask.

Jessica and Gabriel moved quietly, lanterns in hand, each step creaking softly beneath their boots. Mossel had grumbled something about “odd timing” and ”second visits being bad luck,” but he hadn’t stopped them. He’d only made them promise one thing.

“There’s a heap of storm-downed branches behind the schoolhouse,” he’d said that morning, thumping his broom against the cobblestones. ”Needs clearing before it smothers the lilacs. You do that for me, and I’ll turn a blind eye when you slip past tonight.”

Jessica had nodded solemnly.

Gabriel had winced. “Another stump job?”

”Worse,” Mossel had muttered. “It’s wet.”

And now, as they reached the top of the spiral stairs, they carried the weight of that promise along with them.

The wooden door opened without a knock.

Warm golden light spilled into the stairwell. The scent of cedar and moss welcomed them like an old friend.

Inside, Whistlewing perched in his great tangled nest, feathers shimmering silver in the flickering glow of the glowing stones. His head tilted as they entered, and his golden eyes—ancient and endless—blinked slowly.

”You came,” he said softly.

Jessica stepped forward. “You asked.”

Whistlewing shifted slightly, his talons curling into the moss. ”I did. And I am glad.”

He gestured a wing toward the small stone platform at the center of the room. They sat without being told.

“Since your last visit,” Whistlewing began, ”I have kept watch—as I always do. But something has changed in the night air.”

“I have seen movement where none should be. Shadows slipping across rooftops. Flickers of motion behind shutters long closed. Footsteps too soft to be a villager’s, too clumsy to be wind.”

Jessica glanced at Gabriel.

”At first, I thought it nothing more than raccoons,” Whistlewing said. “But no raccoon walks with one boot on and one boot off.”

Gabriel choked back a laugh.

Jessica’s eyes widened. ”Wait. One boot?”

Whistlewing’s beak curved ever so slightly. “Indeed. And they are not alone.”

He leaned forward slightly, feathers shifting like falling snow.

”I need eyes on the ground. Someone the town won’t notice. Someone quiet. Curious. Trustworthy.”

His gaze settled fully on them.

“Tonight, after the square grows still and the lanterns are snuffed, I want you to walk the village. Start near the bakery. Look for clues. Listen for sounds. Do not confront what you find—only observe. Then come back to me with what you’ve learned.”

Gabriel sat straighter. ”You’re saying there really is something out there?”

Whistlewing didn’t blink. “I’m saying there’s something I don’t understand. And that is reason enough.”

There was a pause, soft as down, then he turned to Jessica.

His voice changed. Lower. Warmer.

”And you… child of flour and fire, of stone and sprout… your spark grows brighter.”

Jessica blinked. “My… spark?”

”It is not a thing you hold,” Whistlewing said, “but a thing you are. You carry the breath of the old wild. The whisper of roots and the memory of rain. Magic dwells in you—but it must be coaxed, not claimed.”

Jessica’s cheeks flushed, but she didn’t look away.

”There is one who can guide you,” Whistlewing continued. “She lives at the edge of the village, where the vines grow over the fenceposts and the wind smells of mint and ash. The town calls her the Wisdom.”

Gabriel leaned forward. ”I thought she was just a story.”

“Most good teachers are,” Whistlewing said.

He folded his wings.

”Tonight is the full moon. When the first silver light touches the field outside her door, she will open it. Just once. If you wish to begin learning, you must be there.”

Jessica swallowed. “But—what about the branches for Mossel?”

”That is for you to decide,” Whistlewing said gently. “You made a promise. But you were also offered a gift. And sometimes, those things arrive at the same time.”

The room fell quiet. The air felt full—not heavy, exactly, but thick with possibilities.

Whistlewing studied them both.

”You may not have time to do both. But there may yet be a path between them, if your eyes are sharp and your hearts are steady.”

The door opened behind them again, silent as breath.

Jessica and Gabriel rose.

“Thank you,” Jessica said.

Gabriel hesitated. ”Is there anything else we should know?”

Whistlewing paused.

“Only this,” he said. ”Sometimes, the shadows we fear are nothing more than someone else’s light—seen from the wrong side.”

And with that, the owl turned his gaze toward the high window, where the first sliver of moonlight had begun to pierce the clouds.



## Chapter Seven: The Alley of Eyes


The alley behind the Willowglen Bakery was narrow, crooked, and not particularly well-swept. Crates leaned against the walls in tilted stacks, and the scent of old dough and singed sugar still clung faintly to the bricks. It was the kind of place cats prowled during the day and shadows prowled at night.

Jessica and Gabriel stood at the entrance, lantern in hand, the flickering light throwing long, twitching shapes across the cobblestones. The festival had ended hours ago. Most windows were shuttered. The square was silent.

“This is where the tracks led,” Jessica whispered.

Gabriel nodded. “I saw something move. Just then.”

Then it happened—

One pair of glowing eyes blinked open in the darkness.

Then another.

Then ten more.

A dozen sets of eyes stared back at them from the shadows, low to the ground. The shapes emerged slowly—small bodies, ringed tails, twitching whiskers. Raccoons.

But something was wrong.

They moved in eerie synchrony. One would twitch its head, and the others would follow. One would raise a paw, and the others mimicked the motion exactly. Their movements were too precise, too rehearsed.

All except one.

Near the center of the group stood a raccoon wearing a ragged, reddish-brown cloak clasped with a glinting metal charm. This one didn’t mimic. It directed.

It turned its head, and the others shifted. It blinked, and they scattered behind cover. It raised a paw, and they froze.

Jessica’s breath caught in her throat. “That one... that’s the Ringtailed Ringleader.”

Before they could move, another shape darted across the rooftop above. A cloaked figure—taller, human-shaped—paused just long enough for the lantern light to catch the edge of a scarf fluttering in the wind.

Then the figure vanished over the rooftops.

Gabriel turned. ”Do we go after him?”

Jessica hesitated. The raccoons had started to retreat, skittering toward the far end of the alley.

“No,” she said. ”We follow them.”

The alley curved around the back of the bakery and into a narrow passage flanked by garden walls. The raccoons moved in perfect formation, led by the cloaked one. As they reached the end of the alley, they leapt up onto the wall with surprising agility.

All but one.

Gabriel stepped forward slowly, holding a small stick like a peace offering—or a test.

The Ringtailed Ringleader paused at the top of the wall and turned.

Gabriel extended the stick and gently tapped it against the leader’s side.

The raccoon froze.

It grabbed the stick. Not yanked—**grabbed**. It held Gabriel’s gaze. Its eyes didn’t shimmer with beastly instinct, but with something deeper.

Recognition.

Then it threw the stick down, hard, and let out a hiss loud enough to echo down the alley.

The other raccoons vanished over the wall.

Jessica stepped forward and gasped.

Where the leader had stood, the bricks were still warm. A spiral-shaped claw mark had been seared into the stone.

She fumbled in her pack and pulled out a piece of bakery bread.

“What are you doing?” Gabriel asked.

”I want a record,” she said. She pressed the bread gently to the hot brick.

It didn’t sear cleanly, but when she pulled the bread back, a faint charred spiral remained.

It would have to do.


## Chapter Eight: The Kitchen and the Quiet Listener


Maribel Willowglen stood at her kitchen counter, folding cardamom into warm dough. Her hands moved with practiced rhythm, but her thoughts were elsewhere.

She’d known they were coming. The way children know to come in from the cold, or how bread knows when it’s time to rise.

Jessica and Gabriel arrived just as the rolls were browning. She welcomed them in, guided them to the table, and set out a tray of snacks—still warm, soft with butter, dusted with honey sugar.

She didn’t ask what was wrong.

She didn’t need to.

She listened.

They told her everything. About the owl, the second climb, the whispers in the air. And finally, they spoke of the raccoons. Of the leader. Of the hiss.

That’s when it happened.

Maribel gasped. Not loud. Not sharp. But real.

Jessica noticed. “Mom?”

Maribel turned away, just long enough to steady her expression. ”Sorry. Just surprised.”

But inside, her thoughts raced.

**So it’s true. He really saw it.**

For weeks now, a boy had been coming to her kitchen door. Quiet, hesitant. Not one of hers, but one of her heart nonetheless. Orrin. Gabriel’s younger brother.

He came in secret, always with a question. Sometimes about raccoons. Sometimes about dreams. Sometimes just to sit and eat while she baked.

He had told her about the cloaked one. The Ringtailed Ringleader, he called it. Said it showed him puzzles. Left him signs. Helped him find things—lost things. Once even saved him when he’d fallen into a bramble tangle behind the east fields.

Maribel had never told anyone. Not even Orrin’s parents.

Some children tell stories for attention. Others tell them because they need someone to believe them.

She had chosen to believe.

Now Jessica was confirming it.

But she couldn’t say it. Not yet. Not without breaking the trust of the boy who still knocked quietly and never stayed long.

So she listened. And when they finished, she poured warm cider and offered another roll.

“You’re brave,” she said gently. ”Both of you.”

Jessica frowned. “But what do you think it means?”

Maribel looked at her daughter and smiled. ”I think it means… something old is stirring. And I think you’re part of the reason it’s waking up.”

Jessica didn’t reply. Gabriel looked uncertain.

But the fire in the oven crackled. The bread rose. And somewhere, beyond the edge of town, a ringed tail flicked once before disappearing into the woods.

And Maribel Willowglen, baker and listener, stood very still for a long time after they left.


## Chapter Nine: The Willow River Morning


The morning after the alley encounter dawned gentle and gold, with a crispness in the air that whispered of coming autumn. The mist lifted slowly from the Willow River, curling over its surface like steam from a teacup. Bees hummed lazily around the late-blooming thistle, and the sun cast dappled shadows through the leaves overhead.

Down by the riverbend where the water pooled wide and still, the Willowglen and Thatcher families were setting out a familiar patchwork quilt beneath the willows—a tradition as old as either family could remember.

There were baskets of rolls and hand pies, slices of melon, and a big jar of wildflower honey that Bryna Willowglen insisted on carrying herself. Elaina Thatcher arranged mugs near the edge of the cloth, while Gabriel’s father tried in vain to shoo a particularly bold squirrel away from the cheese tray.

Jessica and Gabriel moved quietly, still wrapped in the strangeness of the night before.

It wasn’t until the food was mostly picked over and the adults had begun swapping stories in easy laughter that they found a moment to slip away. They wandered a little upriver to a quieter bend, where the reeds grew tall and the water burbled over smooth stones.

There, perched on a flat rock with his knees tucked to his chest, sat Orrin.

He looked over his shoulder as they approached, his expression unreadable.

Gabriel flopped down beside him. “You’re up early.”

Orrin didn’t answer right away. He plucked a pebble from the riverbed and rolled it between his fingers. ”Not really,” he said. “I haven’t been sleeping much.”

Jessica sat on the other side of him. ”Because of the raccoons?”

Orrin nodded.

For a while, the only sound was the river.

Then, without looking up, he said, “They come to my window. Sometimes just one or two. Sometimes a whole bunch. They scratch at the glass or leave things—twigs in weird shapes, knots of string, even a watch once. That’s how I know it’s time to go.”

Jessica and Gabriel exchanged a glance but said nothing.

”I follow them,” Orrin continued. “Through alleys, over fences… they always lead me to him. The Ringtailed Ringleader.”

He said the name like it was both a person and a story.

”He doesn’t talk, not like Whistlewing,” Orrin added. “But he… shows me things. Things that don’t make sense until later. Sometimes I think he’s trying to warn me. Other times, it’s like he wants me to see—really see—what’s going on in town.”

Gabriel furrowed his brow. ”Going on how?”

“There’s something wrong,” Orrin said. ”I don’t know what it is. But it’s… spreading. Like cracks in a window. You don’t see them all at once, but they’re there. In the air. In the ground. In people’s eyes when they think no one’s looking.”

Jessica leaned in. “So you’ve been helping the raccoons? Causing mischief?”

Orrin’s ears reddened. ”Yeah. A little. Nothing bad—just stuff to get attention. Knocking over flowerpots. Unstacking chairs. Swapping bakery signs. I thought… maybe if people noticed something was weird, they’d start seeing the other things too.”

“And did they?” Gabriel asked.

Orrin shook his head. ”Mostly they just got mad.”

He let the pebble drop into the water with a soft plop.

Jessica reached out and touched his sleeve gently. “I think we’re starting to see.”

Orrin looked up. For the first time that morning, he smiled—a small, crooked thing, but real.

”I’m glad it’s not just me anymore,” he said.

They sat together in silence after that, the river winding beside them like a long sigh, the air soft with birdsong and the scent of buttered rolls on the breeze.

Farther down the bank, their families laughed over some old story about a goat and a stolen pie, and for a moment the weight of the mystery felt just a little lighter.

But only for a moment.

Because something was wrong in Timberhearth.

And now, all three of them knew it.

Back in her kitchen, Maribel Willowglen paused mid-knead, as if she’d heard something carried on the wind. She looked toward the woods and whispered, “Be careful, Orrin… and the others, too.”



## Chapter Ten: The Patch That Should Not Move


The moon hung high over Timberhearth, its silver light filtering through thin clouds as Jessica and Gabriel crept along the shadowed edge of the village. They carried no lantern this time—only instinct, whispers from the wind, and the strange pull that had been guiding them since nightfall.

They had meant to find Ringtail.

Instead, they found it.

It began with a change in the air—sweet, cloying, like rotting fruit left too long in the sun. Then came the vines. At first just a few, trailing along the path like ivy. But soon they thickened, curling over fenceposts and stone markers like a creeping tide.

The trees thinned. The earth became soft and spongy. And then, past a crooked gate long buried in overgrowth, they saw it.

A pumpkin patch.

But not like any patch they’d ever known.

The pumpkins glowed faintly, not with light, but with attention. They turned toward the cousins as if they were watching. Some were squat and round, others long and lopsided, but all of them pulsed gently, like breathing things.

At the patch’s center stood a broken scarecrow lashed to a splintered post. Its straw-stuffed arms hung limp, but vines threaded through its limbs like veins, tugging it upright. Burned into the wood behind it was a familiar spiral symbol—Ringtail’s mark.

Gabriel reached for Jessica’s sleeve. ”We need to go.”

But before they could turn back, the nearest pumpkin shuddered.

Then another.

And then, with a low, wet rustling, the entire patch began to move.


## Chapter Eleven: The Ring of Sacrifice


“Run!” Jessica shouted, grabbing Gabriel’s wrist.

They sprinted through the underbrush, branches whipping past, feet slipping on moss-covered roots. Behind them, the rustling grew louder. Vines slithered across the ground like snakes, clawing at soil and stone, chasing them with unnatural speed.

Gabriel stumbled, caught on a twisted root. Jessica hauled him upright, breath ragged.

They wouldn’t make it.

A vine lashed out—fast, sharp, like a whip—and caught Gabriel’s boot. He fell.

”Gabriel!” Jessica spun, heart pounding.

The vine curled tighter.

Then—light.

A sudden burst of green-gold radiance shattered the darkness, slamming into the vine with a hiss like steam. It shriveled instantly.

Gabriel looked up.

There, at the edge of the patch, stood Ringtail.

He was panting. His cloak torn. His silver-touched fur stained with soot and sap. But his eyes burned with purpose.

He raised both paws.

“Back!” he roared—not in raccoon chatter, but in something older. Deeper. Magic made language.

A ring of sigils blazed into the earth around Gabriel and Jessica, pushing the vines outward like a shield. The patch recoiled, writhing in fury.

Jessica reached for him. ”Ringtail—”

“No time,” he growled. ”Tell Whistlewing. The seal is failing. The blight is awake.”

Another vine lashed forward. Ringtail caught it with a clawed hand and flung it aside, but the effort dropped him to one knee.

Gabriel moved toward him. “We can help—”

Ringtail looked up. There was pain in his eyes. And peace.

”You already are.”

Then, with one final flick of his paw, the sigil ring burst into a column of light, and the patch fell back, shrieking in fury and retreating to the dark earth.

Ringtail collapsed.

Jessica grabbed Gabriel’s hand. “We have to go. Now.”

And they ran—tears in their eyes, hearts in their throats—back toward the clock tower and the one who might still hold the answers.


## Chapter Twelve: The Circle of Thirteen


The climb to the top of the tower had never felt so long.

Jessica and Gabriel burst into Whistlewing’s roost just as the clock struck three. The great owl looked up from his perch, feathers already ruffled with worry.

”You saw it,” he said. Not a question.

Gabriel nodded, pale and shaking. “The patch… it chased us.”

”Ringtail stopped it,” Jessica whispered. “But he… he’s hurt.”

Whistlewing closed his eyes. ”Then there’s no more time for hoping.”

For the first time, they saw weariness in him—his feathers dulled at the edges, and his voice trembled slightly, as if the weight of centuries had begun to press harder.

He turned and drew aside a curtain Jessica hadn’t noticed before. Behind it was a curved wall carved with thirteen sigils—one of them pulsing gently with light.

“Ringtail was the first to awaken. And now you’ve seen why we must find the rest.”

He looked back at them.

”There were thirteen Guardians,” he said. “Each one gave up their old life to bind the Wither. Animal and human, spirit and sage. We were sealed to new forms, hidden from the enemy... and from ourselves.”

Gabriel stepped closer. ”But why?”

Whistlewing’s voice was grave. “Because if the Wither found us, it would destroy us. And without us, the seal would collapse.”

He pointed his wing to the sigils. ”Some still remember. Others have forgotten who they are. Some may have even turned bitter—or been twisted by the blight. But we must find them all.”

Jessica placed her hand on her stone leaf. It pulsed with warmth.

“Your gifts are part of the seal,” Whistlewing said. ”They resonate with us. You will be drawn to those you are meant to find.”

Gabriel held up his heart-shaped crystal. It flickered faintly.

“There are eleven still hidden,” Whistlewing continued. ”Seek them in the woods, in the streets, in the places forgotten by time. Listen to those who speak in riddles. Watch those who walk alone. Trust your gifts.”

Jessica looked up. “And Ringtail?”

Whistlewing closed his eyes again. ”He will endure. Or he will not. But either way, the task remains.”

The owl’s gaze sharpened.

“The Creeping Wither is stirring beneath our feet. And if we do not gather the Guardians… there will be nothing left for it to devour but us.”



Before the next full moon had passed, whispers of new Guardians stirred again in Timberhearth.


## Chapter Thirteen: The Deer and the Fox


The moon hung low over Timberhearth, casting long silver shadows across the rooftops. Somewhere, a raccoon chattered from a chimney. Somewhere else, an owl turned silently on its perch. But all eyes in town—animal or otherwise—eventually drifted toward the strange creature hobbling across the square.

It was, unmistakably, a deer.

Or at least, it was trying to be.

The costume sagged in the middle, held up by broomsticks, mismatched ropes, and what may once have been a pair of flour sacks. Its antlers were lopsided and painted the color of bark—though they more closely resembled wilted carrots. The front half trotted forward with purpose, while the back half stumbled to keep up.

Jessica was in the front. Gabriel brought up the rear.

And Poodler—Jessica’s family dog, loyal and completely unconvinced—trotted beside them, barking the entire way.

”Stop stepping on my foot!” Gabriel hissed.

“I’m the front legs! You’re supposed to match me!” Jessica whispered back.

The deer swayed to the side and nearly collided with the bakery cart. Behind them, a curtain twitched. Somewhere, someone whispered, ”Is that… is that a deer in a scarf?”

Children pointed from windows. One bold toddler cheered. Poodler barked again. It was unclear if she was trying to protect the deer, warn the deer, or eat the deer.

By the time they reached the edge of the village, the costume had already lost a hoof, one of the antlers had spun backward, and Gabriel had developed an impressive cramp in his left leg.

But Jessica kept going, determined.

They weren’t wearing the costume just for fun.

They were wearing it for Mira.

The path to the shrine wound southeast through tangled underbrush and creeping vines. The farther they walked, the quieter the world became. No wind. No insects. Even the moonlight dimmed beneath the trees.

And then they smelled it.

A faint, cloying sweetness—like pumpkin left too long in the sun.

“Blight,” Jessica whispered.

Gabriel shivered.

They moved carefully, the deer swaying left and right like it was drunk. Poodler, now taking things very seriously, growled low in her throat. She kept to Jessica’s side, ears flat, tail low.

Just when Gabriel was about to complain again, the trees opened into a clearing.

And there it was.

The shrine.

It might once have been beautiful. Stone arches curled with vines stood half-sunken into moss. A ring of lilies surrounded the center, white and trembling like frightened stars. But some had turned dark at the tips. Vines threaded through the roots like veins. The blight was here too.

The deer costume stopped abruptly.

Jessica whispered, ”Do you see anything?”

“No,” Gabriel whispered back. ”Do you see anything?”

Poodler barked once.

Then a voice, soft and sly, slipped through the trees:

“Oh my. What a rare and majestic creature wanders into my grove tonight.”

Jessica nearly jumped out of the costume.

Gabriel shrieked and dropped the broomstick, collapsing the deer in half.

The voice chuckled.

”Oh no. You’re injured. Let me guess… a fawn born too soon? Or perhaps a particularly clumsy elk?”

Jessica scrambled up, brushing leaves from her apron. “Sorry! Sorry. We didn’t mean to—”

The voice grew closer, warmer.

”I know what you are, children. You’re not here for disguise. You’re here for me.”

From the shadows, a silver shape emerged.

A fox—graceful, gleaming, with fur like moonlight and eyes like old winter. She moved with the confidence of someone who had been watching for a very long time.

Jessica and Gabriel stood frozen.

“You’re Mira,” Jessica breathed.

The fox bowed her head.

”I am. Or I was. Or perhaps I will be again.” She looked at their crumpled costume. “You came in laughter, but the path ahead holds little joy.”

Gabriel stepped forward. ”We want to help.”

Mira tilted her head. “Then you must walk the Path of Balance.”

The world shimmered.

The vines faded. The shrine disappeared. The clearing became a vast nothingness, save for a single narrow bridge made of woven light and curling shadow.

Mira’s voice echoed from nowhere and everywhere at once.

”One of you will carry the light. One of you will bear the shadow. Together, you must walk in perfect harmony. Move too quickly, and you will fall. Move too selfishly, and you will break the path.”

Jessica reached out and took the soft golden orb that hovered to her side. It pulsed with warmth.

Gabriel, trembling slightly, took the orb of darkness. It swirled with whispers.

They stepped onto the bridge.

At first, it was awkward. Jessica’s pace was too quick. Gabriel hesitated. The bridge groaned beneath them. Below, shadows swirled and vines writhed like snakes.

“Left foot!” Jessica whispered.

”Which left!?” Gabriel hissed.

Poodler barked from somewhere behind them.

Then came the vines.

They lashed up from below, curling toward their legs.

Jessica’s light flared, driving some back—but dimmed quickly.

Gabriel stepped into the shadows, hiding them both, but the cold filled his lungs and made his knees tremble.

They were failing.

Until they reached out—hands clasping, breath matching, one step… then another… together.

The bridge grew stronger beneath them.

At last, they reached the other side.

Mira stood waiting.

“You kept balance,” she said. ”Even in fear. Even in doubt. That is rare.”

She stepped forward, nose nearly brushing Jessica’s hand.

“But my task is not yet done. The blight has grown strong, and I alone hold it back. If I leave, Timberhearth will suffer. You must return to me later, when the path is clearer.”

Gabriel nodded slowly. ”We understand.”

Mira’s eyes softened. “You are brave, in your own way. Foolish, too. But brave.”

She turned, silver tail flicking once through the air.

”Oh—and next time?” she added, glancing over her shoulder.

“Leave the deer behind.”

Then she vanished.

Back through the woods they went, their breath puffing in the cold, the deer costume folded under one arm. Poodler trotted ahead, tail wagging like she’d known all along.

Gabriel rubbed his leg. ”I think I pulled a muscle.”

Jessica smiled faintly. “I think we found a Guardian.”

”Yeah,” Gabriel said. “One down. Ten to go.”

And together, they stepped into the night, toward whatever came next.

Far behind them, a faint rustle moved through the distant vines. The blight was not gone—it was waiting.



## Chapter Fourteen: The Sealing of **Vendraxis**



A Fragment from the Tome of Hollowroot, Dated Year 1 of the Quiet Age

”Let this be written in stone and spirit, that the story of our fall and our rising not be lost.“

Seven hundred twenty-two years ago, long before Timberhearth was carved from pine and stone, this land was known as Hollowroot Vale. It was a peaceful place—more peaceful, perhaps, than the world deserved. Its rivers ran sweet, its orchards bent low with fruit, and its people lived by kinship rather than coin. Children played in the meadows until the moon rose, and doors were rarely locked.

Among those people lived two souls of particular note. One was Elric Brightfeather, a scholar-clockmaker whose tower sang with soft bells and whose hands were always ink-stained. He was gentle, meticulous, and beloved by all who sought wisdom. The other was Kaelen of the Glades, a half-wild youth raised more by raccoons than men, with dirt on his cheeks and mischief in his smile. Kaelen stole only what others wasted, and gave away more than he kept.

When the change came, it came quietly.

A shadow fell across the eastern hills—not from the sun, but from the soil. Pumpkins, long a symbol of Hollowroot’s harvest joy, grew bloated and twisted. Their vines burrowed deep into the earth, coiling with strange intelligence. The seeds, once toasted and shared at festivals, began to carry… something else. Those who ate them found dreams not their own creeping into their minds. One child spoke in voices that weren't his. A man vanished, leaving behind only a patch of slick rot where he’d slept.

Elric was the first to suspect. Kaelen was the first to see. And both agreed—they could not face this evil alone.

The source, they learned, was no curse or blight, but a presence: **Vendraxis**, the Creeping Wither, an ancient being that fed not on blood, but on excess—on overgrowth, waste, and slothful magic left unattended. He was awakening, not arriving. His roots had always been beneath the world, but now they stirred.

Elric and Kaelen gathered others—leaders not of armies, but of life.

There was Mira Cinderglen, whose bakery hearth warmed half the Vale and whose kindness was legend—she would later be known as Embermane, the fox whose fire never dies. She saw the rot in her flour and felt the wrongness in the dough.

Bramm the Forge-Hand, who spoke little but shaped sigils into steel, saw his anvil crack without cause.

Sister Aldith, veiled and soft-spoken, read the moon and dreamed of vines choking the stars.

Torren Wex, a carpenter with laughter in his lungs, found his ladders snapped by branches that grew overnight.

Even Garron Holt, the gruff old miner who hadn't come to a town feast in decades, appeared at the Hollowroot Tree, saying nothing but standing firm.

They met beneath that ancient tree, its roots deep and wise. There, Thalia Grimbrow, the boisterous tavern-keeper who once arm-wrestled a bear (or so she claimed), poured the circle's first cup of binding mead. She had seen her barrels sour without reason and knew something deep was wrong.

Thirteen came. Thirteen stood.

To banish **Vendraxis** was impossible. But to bind him—that could be done. At terrible cost.

The Covenant of Binding, an ancient rite known only through fragments of myth, required more than strength. It required the surrender of form. Each of them would give up their humanity, assuming the spirit of a creature aligned to their essence. They would become the Guardians Eternal, neither beast nor mortal, watching over the prison for as long as the seal held.

Elric, keeper of time and thought, became Whistlewing, the great owl.

Kaelen, the trickster with a loyal heart, took the form of Ringtail, the raccoon.

Mira’s warmth burned into Embermane, the fox whose fire never dies.

Bramm became Stoneback, the unyielding badger.

Sister Aldith took the wings of Mothshade, drifting between waking and dream.

Torren became Hearthgnaw, the bold and acrobatic squirrel.

Garron descended into the soil as Gnarltooth, the mole.

Thalia, strong and joyous, transformed into Bramblegut, the great boar—her laughter now an echo through the roots.

Others—Mistpelt the deer, Glintleap the frog, Flicker the mouse, Skyflutter the butterfly, and Glowfern the cat—each lent their spirit to the seal.

Together, they formed a living ward. At the center of the ritual stood the pumpkin, twisted and corrupted. It became both key and lock. To anchor the spell, a tradition was seeded: never eat pumpkin seeds. For within each one, a fragment of **Vendraxis** still slumbered. The act of eating one would be to invite him back, piece by piece.

The Vale’s people were told this truth, but as generations passed, the memory dulled. Warnings became folklore. Folklore became superstition. And superstition became jokes. Yet the tradition held.

To this day, no one in Timberhearth eats pumpkin seeds. Ask them why, and each will give a different reason.

”They cause warts.”
“They attract goblins.”
”My uncle ate one and turned orange.”

But the truth sleeps beneath their feet.

The Guardians endured. Hidden in feather, fur, and fang, they watched. They waited.

But the world forgets. And when the world forgets, the seal grows thin.

“Forget not the price once paid. Forget not the forms now taken. Forget not the seeds that sleep in shadow.”


## Chapter Fifteen: The Mole Who Dug Too Deep


A week had passed since the encounter with Mira. The deer costume had been packed away (mostly intact), and though Gabriel still walked with a slight limp and Jessica refused to talk about how much mud had gotten in her shoes, both had been thinking about the silver fox every day since.

Now, with a free Saturday stretched before them and the last of the harvest air hanging warm and lazy over Timberhearth, they made their way through the outskirts of town with a quiet sense of purpose.

No disguises this time. Just two friends, walking side by side.

They brought with them a small parcel of bakery pretzels and a few coppers tucked into their pockets. Not because they expected to buy anything—just because it felt right to come prepared. That, and Poodler insisted on tagging along, and Poodler always found a reason to demand snacks.

They passed the edge of the square, slipped between two crumbling stone walls, and wound their way along the southern ridge that curved gently toward Mira’s grove.

The leaves rustled overhead. The breeze smelled faintly of cinnamon and moss.

But when they reached the clearing, she wasn’t there.

There was no sign of Mira. No shimmer of fur. No sly voice from the shadows. Only the hush of wind and the whisper of leaves.

Then a bark split the silence.

Poodler.

The white-furred dog was standing at the far edge of the clearing, tail rigid, ears perked forward. He was staring down at something… odd.

A rusted metal ring, half-buried in the earth.

Jessica stepped forward cautiously.

Gabriel crouched beside the ring. ”Is this a trapdoor?”

Poodler barked once, then began spinning in a tight circle, sneezed twice, and sat down with his entire back end planted squarely on the ring.

Jessica raised an eyebrow. “I think he wants us to open it.”

Gabriel blinked. ”Or he’s just really into cold dirt. Hard to say.”

But Jessica was already reaching for the ring.

The hatch groaned as it opened, releasing a gust of damp, earthy air. Below, a narrow stone tunnel sloped down into darkness. Roots dangled from the ceiling like ancient fingers. Something pulsed softly in the depths—a faint glow, green and warm like breathing moss.

Poodler bolted inside without hesitation.

Gabriel sighed. “We’re following him, aren’t we?”

Jessica nodded. ”Of course we are.”

The tunnels were strange.

They weren’t just old—they felt old. Older than Timberhearth. Older than Hollowroot, even. The stones were carved with long-faded runes, and the walls were dotted with glowing lichen and stones that whispered when you passed too close.

Poodler moved ahead confidently… though not always logically.

He stopped to bark at one wall, licked a mushroom that made him sneeze three times in rapid succession, and circled a stalagmite as if it held the secrets of the universe—then immediately tried to pee on it.

At one point, he darted ahead, then doubled back to bring them a very serious piece of bark he found, dropped it at Gabriel’s feet, and stared at it with such intensity that for a moment, they both thought it might be magical.

It wasn’t.

But Poodler wagged his tail anyway.

Finally, the tunnel opened into a wide chamber.

The floor was soft with moss. The walls were studded with crystals, pulsing in soft rhythms, and massive roots twisted along the ceiling like frozen lightning.

And in the center of it all sat a Guardian.

He was massive. Not tall—but wide, grounded, solid. His claws were chipped but strong. His fur was matted with earth, and his amber eyes glowed faintly from beneath a heavy brow.

He was carving something into stone—slow, careful movements, like the world depended on the spacing of his lines.

When he saw them, he paused.

“You brought the loud one,” the mole said, nodding at Poodler. ”That must mean it’s serious.”

Jessica stepped forward. “Are you… Gnarltooth?”

The mole rumbled deep in his chest. ”Used to be Garron Holt. Took this shape to hold the roots back. Been down here ever since.”

Gabriel opened his mouth, but before he could speak, Poodler trotted forward and—without warning—sat directly on Gnarltooth’s foot.

Gnarltooth blinked. “Well. That’s direct.”

He turned and rummaged through a stone chest nearby.

”He brought the scroll, didn’t he? Smelled like bacon and old secrets. Not sure he ever understood the urgency.”

Jessica nodded. “He’s been… very helpful. Sort of.”

Gnarltooth pulled out something small and strange—a tiny vest stitched with silver thread, embroidered with runes, and fitted with a glowing cravat.

”Put this on him. And be quick about it. The magic’s got a time limit.”

Gabriel hesitated. “He’s not going to like it.”

He did not.

It took two muffins, a piece of jerky, and Gabriel promising never to brush his fur again, but eventually, the vest was fastened.

The moment it clicked closed, the crystal lit up—and Poodler sat bolt upright.

”HELLO! I HAVE OPINIONS AND YOU’RE GOING TO HEAR THEM!”

Jessica yelped.

Gabriel dropped the muffin.

Poodler beamed, tail thumping like a drum.

“Okay okay okay—first of all, the scroll? Tasted terrible. Like moldy socks and ambition. Second, that rock I barked at? I thought it was Jeff. Third—YES I ATE THE BACON BEHIND THE STOVE, I’D DO IT AGAIN.”

He spun in a circle.

”This vest is INCREDIBLE. Do I have arms? I think I have arms now. Are these words? Is this how you feel all the time???”

Gnarltooth groaned. “Eight minutes. Maybe less if he chews it.”

Poodler gasped. ”I WOULD NEVER CHEW MY OWN POWER—unless it smelled like cheese. Or squirrel. Or squirrel cheese.”

Jessica laughed so hard she nearly sat down.

But then, something shifted.

Gnarltooth turned away slightly, claws tracing idle lines in the moss.

Jessica noticed the way his shoulders hunched.

She stepped forward.

“Do you… do you want to reconnect? With Timberhearth? Or the other Guardians?”

The question hung in the air like mist.

Gnarltooth didn’t answer at first. Then he spoke, voice soft as shifting soil.

”I think about it all the time.”

He told them everything. About how he’d once lived near the edge of town. How he’d been awkward and too loud, too quiet, too strange. How he’d chosen to dig down instead of stand out.

“I thought I was helping. I thought… maybe I was better off here. Alone. Safe. Predictable. But lately… the silence is louder than it used to be.”

Poodler, somehow understanding, trotted over and rested his head on Gnarltooth’s knee.

”You smell like belonging,” he said quietly.

Gnarltooth didn’t move for a long time.

Then he gave a single nod.

“Maybe… maybe you could take a message back. Just to start.”

Gabriel smiled. ”We can do that.”

Jessica took his hand. “We’ll come back, too.”

Gnarltooth reached for his carving tools.

”Good. Bring snacks next time.”

As they climbed back toward the hatch, Poodler gave one last bark.

“REMEMBER ME AS I WAS—NOT AS I BARKED—”

The vest fizzled out.

He sat down.

Scratched his ear.

And licked Gabriel’s shoe.

Jessica and Gabriel laughed the whole way home.

And beneath them, far below, the mole began to carve his first message in a very, very long time.


## Chapter Sixteen: The Cat-tastic Adventure


The morning sun slanted through the Willowglen Bakery windows, filling the air with motes of flour that danced like snowflakes in the light. The scent of honey bread, warm butter, and cinnamon still hung thick in the air when Jessica walked in with Gabriel and Poodler trotting close behind.

Maribel Willowglen stood at the counter, arms folded, gazing suspiciously at a half-eaten loaf.

”It’s the mice again,” she said grimly. “Little devils got into the flour bin last night. I caught one inside the measuring cup this morning. Bold as brass.”

Jessica perked up immediately.

”You know what we need? A cat!”

Maribel frowned.

“A cat? I’m not sure I have the patience for another creature that ignores me half the time and sheds the other half.”

Gabriel grinned. ”They’re excellent mousers though.”

Jessica clasped her hands together.

“Just one. A good one. I’ll make a sign! It’ll be cute and tidy and—”

Maribel sighed in defeat, wiping her hands on her apron.

”Fine. One cat. And only one. None of this ‘bringing home a litter because they looked hungry’ nonsense.”

Jessica beamed, grabbed parchment and ink, and carefully wrote:

Wanted: One Cat for Adoption

It was neat, clear, and perfectly legible. But as she turned toward the clock tower bells outside, she realized they were already late for their morning errands.

“Poodler, could you be a dear and hang this in the window?”

Poodler’s ears shot up. His tail began wagging so fast it blurred.

”YES! Important mission! Window duty!”

Jessica handed him the parchment. Poodler took it delicately in his mouth, puffed out his chest, and trotted toward the front. But as his tail swished in triumph, it caught the edge of the inkpot.

SPLAT.

Ink splattered in one glorious arc across the parchment—right between the words “One” and ”Cat.” The blob bled and curved until it looked unmistakably like the word “Every.”

By the time Poodler proudly pressed it into the windowpane, the sign now read:

Wanted: EVERY Cat for Adoption.

He wagged his tail again, admiring his work. A few townsfolk walking by chuckled. A few more stopped to read. And by evening, word had spread:

The Willowglen Bakery was adopting cats. All of them.

The Quiet Night Before the Storm

That evening, Timberhearth’s villagers began stopping by the bakery one by one, each cradling a kitten or two.

”They’ve been behind our shed for weeks,” said Mrs. Thistlepot. “Thought you could use some help.”
”Ours were born in the hayloft,” said old Garron Holt’s cousin. “Good mousers, all of ’em.”
”Found this one in the flour wagon,” said a farmer, holding up something that might once have been white but was now vaguely brownish and mewing loudly.”

By closing time, the bakery had gained a modest pile of baskets, each containing a small, furry occupant.

Maribel shook her head, muttering, “We’ll sort them in the morning,” and went to bed.

The kittens purred softly through the night.

Then more arrived.

No one saw who left them—only that by dawn, the baskets had multiplied.

The Great Kitten Calamity

When Jessica and Gabriel opened the door the next morning, the sound hit them first.

Mewing. Everywhere.

The bakery was a scene of adorable anarchy.

Kittens were swinging from the bread racks like acrobats.

Three flour-covered cats had turned the mixing bowl into a snowstorm.

One particularly fluffy orange kitten was perched on the cash box, guarding it with all the seriousness of a dragon atop its hoard.

Two black kittens were wrestling in a basket of croissants.

A tiny calico had curled up inside a measuring cup and refused to leave.

And poor Poodler sat in the middle of it all, completely overwhelmed, with five kittens hanging off his tail.

”Jessica!” Gabriel choked out between laughs. “What did you do?”

”I think,” Jessica said faintly, “we got every cat.”

Maribel emerged from the back room, holding her rolling pin like a weapon.

”I knew I should’ve gone with mousetraps.”

The Cat Who Watched

Amid the chaos, one cat was not playing.

A sleek silver cat sat atop the bakery windowsill, perfectly still, tail curled neatly around her paws. Her fur shimmered faintly, as though dusted with starlight, and her green eyes followed every movement with calm authority.

The kittens seemed to listen to her—when she flicked her tail, they paused; when she turned her head, they moved aside.

“Gabriel,” Jessica whispered, ”do you see that one?”
“Yeah,” he murmured. ”She’s… organizing them.”

The cat turned its gaze toward them. It wasn’t the vacant, sleepy look of an ordinary cat—it was sharp, intelligent, and faintly amused.

She leapt gracefully from the sill and padded toward the back door. Then she looked back over her shoulder, met Jessica’s eyes, and blinked slowly. Once.

Then she slipped out into the alley.

Jessica didn’t hesitate. “We’re following her.”
Gabriel groaned, brushing croissant crumbs off his sleeve. ”Of course we are.”

Poodler barked, a kitten still dangling from his tail.

“Wait for me! I think they’re unionizing!”

The Guardian of Grace, Fur, and Sass

The silver cat led them through the quiet cobbled streets, never running, only glancing back to make sure they followed. She darted between barrels, leapt onto a low fence, and finally stopped in a small sunlit courtyard where ivy crept up the walls.

She sat down, tail curling delicately around her paws. The air shimmered faintly.

Then, without moving her mouth, a voice echoed in their minds—smooth, silky, and utterly self-assured.

”You walk like unbalanced chairs.”

Jessica jumped. “Did—did you just—”

”Yes, yes. I am speaking. Do try to keep up.”

The cat stretched languidly.

“You may call me Glowfern. Guardian of Poise, Keeper of Sunbeams, Napper of the Fifth Hour, and—” she paused, licking her paw— ”occasional savior of small towns infested with mice and mediocrity.”

Gabriel gaped. “You’re… one of the Guardians?”

”Was. Am. Will be. It’s complicated. You wouldn’t understand without naps.”

Jessica tried to curtsy, realized she was talking to a cat, and settled for a polite nod.

“We’re honored to meet you, Glowfern.”

”Of course you are,” Glowfern purred. “But honor is earned. I require a demonstration of grace, patience, and service.”

She flicked her tail toward a bench where three kittens had inexplicably decided to sleep in a pyramid.

”Begin.”

The Three Trials of Glowfern

Trial One: The Balance of Grace
Glowfern leapt onto a wobbling barrel and demanded they do the same. Jessica managed elegantly—until a kitten decided her braid was a toy. Gabriel’s attempt ended in an impressive spin and a crash into a crate of cabbages.

Trial Two: The Patience of the Hunt
Glowfern made them wait perfectly still beside a bowl, claiming an invisible mouse was beneath it. After twenty minutes, the “mouse” turned out to be a shimmer of magic that darted away, leaving Jessica cross-eyed and Poodler asleep upside-down.

Trial Three: The Will to Serve
Finally, Glowfern flopped onto her back and demanded brushing—then summoned every kitten in the courtyard to join her. The result was a blur of fur, purring, and mild chaos.

”Yes,” Glowfern murmured smugly. “You’ll do.”

She yawned, conjured a soft silver whisker from thin air, and dropped it at Jessica’s feet.

”A gift. Use it wisely—or humorously. Either is fine.”

She rose, eyes half-lidded with amusement.

“And now, I have a sunbeam to attend to. Farewell, my slightly less-clumsy apprentices.”

With that, she leapt gracefully onto the wall and vanished into the rooftops.

Back at the bakery, Maribel stood amid a much smaller group of cats—only a few dozen now, neatly lined along the counter.

She crossed her arms as Jessica walked in.

”Next time,” she said dryly, “I’m writing my own signs.”

Jessica smiled, holding up the silver whisker.

”At least we got our mouser.”

Poodler sighed happily, already surrounded by a small pile of kittens.

“Best. Day. Ever.”

And somewhere above Timberhearth, on a roof warmed by sunlight, Glowfern purred contentedly to herself.

”Perhaps,” she mused, “these humans are finally starting to learn the proper way to serve.”
