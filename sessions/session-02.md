# Session 2 – The Stump and the Shadows

Morning broke over Timberhearth with unease. Gabriel awoke late—a rarity—but stranger still, his younger brother [Orrin](../characters/family/orrin-thatcher.md) had not yet stirred. Meanwhile, Jessica enjoyed a quiet breakfast of hot cross buns and a brief, knowing conversation with her mother, [Maribel Willowglen](../characters/family/maribel-willowglen.md).

Reuniting, the friends packed for a short trip into the woods to gather materials for a bow and arrows. But as they passed by Mossel’s cottage, he flagged them down. The stump was still waiting. With a mouthful of pretzel and some gentle persuasion, [Mossel](../characters/npcs/mossel.md) convinced them to postpone their adventure to the woods—danger lurked beyond the trees, he warned. The two agreed and spent the day digging alongside him, gathering a few sturdy sticks in the process.

As evening fell, Gabriel and Jessica returned to the alley. This time, it was not just a pair of eyes that greeted them. An entire pack of raccoons emerged, moving in eerie synchrony. At their center was one raccoon unlike the others—a cloaked figure, regal in bearing, commanding the group with subtle, magical grace. From a nearby rooftop, a mysterious cloaked figure watched silently before vanishing into the night.

The friends had a choice: pursue the shadowy human or follow the raccoons. They chose the latter. The group scattered over the rear wall, but not before the cloaked raccoon—the [Ringtailed Ringleader](../characters/npcs/ringtailed-ringleader.md)—paused, locked eyes with them, and hissed, deep and fierce. Jessica, quick-thinking and curious, took a piece of bread and tried to burn the strange claw-shaped mark she had seen into it using the heat of her latent magic. The result was faint but unmistakable.
