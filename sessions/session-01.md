# Session 1 – The Night of Voices

On a crisp autumn evening, the village of Timberhearth gathered beneath flickering lanterns for its most sacred tradition: **The Night of Voices**. It is the night when each sixteen-year-old climbs the ancient clock tower to meet the mysterious guardian owl known as **Whistlewing**, who bestows insight, guidance, and a personal gift that marks the beginning of adulthood.

As the ceremony began, **Mayor Kempthorne** addressed the village with a steady, reverent tone. His speech was followed by the solemn call of Whistlewing, echoing from the top of the tower:

> “Rowan Brightleaf. Come.”

And so it began. One by one, the town’s youth ascended the narrow stairwell:
- **Rowan Brightleaf** returned thoughtful, more grounded than before.
- **Mira Tansy** emerged laughing, silver-eyed with wonder.
- **Thomlin Gray**, a known bully, came down quiet and ashamed, offering an unspoken apology with his eyes.
- **Elsbet Miller**, **Calder Vane**, and **Nessa Wren** followed—each returning changed in some small, subtle way.

Before it was their turn, **Jessica Willowglen** and **Gabriel Thatcher** received the traditional gifts from their families. These gifts are meant to support the youths as they begin their journey into adulthood:
- Gabriel received **65 coalmarks**, a modest but meaningful show of love from his family.
- Jessica was given **250 coalmarks**, reflecting the success and high expectations of the **Willowglen Bakery** family.

Still, their names were not called. Alphabetical order is sacred at the ceremony—always followed. The delay sparked murmurs and sideways glances. Jessica’s mother looked toward the elders. Gabriel shifted uncomfortably near the fountain.

Then came something unheard of in all of Timberhearth’s memory:

> “Jessica. Gabriel. Come together.”

A hush fell over the crowd. No two youths had ever been summoned at once. The townspeople stood in stunned silence as the two friends stepped forward and began their climb.

### The Climb

At the tower’s base, a heavy wooden door creaked open. Inside, a spiral staircase wound upward, dimly lit by faintly glowing stones embedded into the walls. With each step, the world below slipped away. The distant voices of the villagers faded, replaced by the soft hoot of an owl and the whisper of unseen winds.

After a long, reverent ascent, they reached the top.

The chamber was round and open to the sky. Wind flowed through stone archways, rustling scrolls and feathers that filled carved wooden shelves. And in the center, perched across a worn timber beam, sat **Whistlewing**—larger than expected, nearly two feet tall, with rippling feathers and golden eyes that shimmered with starlight.

When he spoke, his voice did not come from his beak, but from within—heard not by ears, but by the heart:

> “You have come. Together. Rare… but not unwelcome.”

He asked them to speak—not of what others believed about them, but of what they knew, deep within. He listened without judgment. And then he gave them each a gift:

- **Jessica** received a **leaf-shaped charm**, delicate but strong, with silver veins—her “spark of nature,” a seed waiting to be nurtured.
- **Gabriel** received a **dark stone**, smooth and warm, with a glowing ember at its core—a symbol of his gift to unite what is broken, if he can first find unity within himself.

> “These are not weapons. Not tools. Not prizes. They are seeds. How they grow depends on you.”

Before they left, Whistlewing offered one final warning:

> “The world you know is not the whole world. Soon, it will begin to open... Be kind to the story that follows you.”

### Afterward

As Jessica and Gabriel returned to the square, they felt the weight of the town’s eyes on them—curious, cautious, awed. Though their descent was quiet, a sense of transformation clung to the air. Whistlewing had seen something in them, and Timberhearth itself seemed to sense that something new had begun.

And in the tower, the owl still watched.
