# Session 1 – The Night of Voices

The summer was winding to a close in the village of [Timberhearth](../README.md), and two close friends, [Gabriel](../characters/gabriel.md) and [Jessica](../characters/jessica.md), had just turned sixteen—an age of quiet importance in their town. As tradition dictated, they were summoned to the edge of the woods to meet [Whistlewing](../characters/npcs/whistlewing.md), the elusive and wise owl who watched over the village’s rites of passage.

Beneath starlight and owl feathers, Whistlewing spoke to each of them in turn. He gifted Gabriel a dark crystal shaped like a heart, telling him it carried the power to bring people together—if he could first learn to cultivate that power within himself. Jessica received a delicate stone leaf, veined like lace, and was told it held the spark of nature within her. The owl’s words were heavy with mystery and warning: strange forces were stirring in Timberhearth, and the two friends would soon be asked to act.

Whistlewing charged them with a triad of tasks—gather supplies, seek wisdom, and investigate unusual tracks—before the day was out. Eager to prove themselves, they struck a deal with [Mossel](../characters/npcs/mossel.md), a gruff local who needed help removing a stubborn tree stump. In exchange for help, Mossel promised them a second audience with the owl. When time grew short, they negotiated a delay with 200 coalmarks as collateral.

Their journey led them to [Ivan Ranger](../characters/npcs/ivan-ranger.md)’s general store, where Gabriel purchased a lantern and Jessica some oil.

Next, they visited [Shanna Parsnip](../characters/npcs/shanna-parsnip.md), the town’s wisdom, who explained the use of Moonsparks—crystallized moments of magical potential—and offered Jessica a choice of spells.

That evening, curiosity pulled them into an alley behind the bakery, where a pair of glowing eyes stared back at them from the darkness.

A sudden surge of fear drove them home.
