# Session 3 – Secrets and Trust

The encounter with the raccoons weighed heavily on both of them, but Jessica found comfort in confiding in her mother. She told [Maribel Willowglen](../characters/family/maribel-willowglen.md) everything—about the owl, the gifts, the glowing eyes, and the [Ringtailed Ringleader](../characters/npcs/ringtailed-ringleader.md). When she spoke the raccoon’s name, Maribel gasped. Though she could not say why, it was clear she knew something.

In truth, Maribel had been keeping a secret: young [Orrin](../characters/family/orrin-thatcher.md) had been visiting her in secret for weeks, sharing stories of a strange raccoon he had met. A raccoon who wore a cloak and seemed to understand more than an animal should. Though Jessica didn’t know it yet, her brother’s connection to the magical happenings in Timberhearth ran deeper than anyone suspected.

Meanwhile, [Gabriel](../characters/gabriel.md) and [Jessica](../characters/jessica.md) grew closer, their shared trust in one another forming a bond that would become crucial in the days ahead. Whispers of magic, secrets, and stirring spirits wove tighter around the quiet village, and the feeling lingered: this was only the beginning.
