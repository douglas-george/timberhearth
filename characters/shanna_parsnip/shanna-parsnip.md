[[Shanna Parsnip](shanna-parsnip.md)](characters/shanna_parsnip/shanna-parsnip.md) is the town wisdom of Timberhearth. With her quiet demeanor and thoughtful presence, she helps young people access their magical potential. She offers spells in exchange for Moonsparks, and she seems to know more about the world’s magic than she openly shares.

Recently, Timberhearth faced a frightening challenge when the sinister sorcerer Vendraxis unleashed an army of Creeping Wither pumpkins to attack the village. These enchanted pumpkins began creeping through the streets, trying to cause mischief and spread gloom. Jessica Willowglen and her brave son, seven-year-old Gabriel Thatcher, teamed up alongside Gabriel’s loyal dog, Poodler, to protect their home. The trio worked together, cleverly guiding the pumpkins away from homes and helping neighbors stay safe. Though they stopped most of the pumpkins, the battle was fierce and the town fountain, a beloved centerpiece of Timberhearth, was sadly destroyed in the chaos. Despite this, the courage and quick thinking of Jessica, Gabriel, and Poodler kept the village safe and hopeful.
