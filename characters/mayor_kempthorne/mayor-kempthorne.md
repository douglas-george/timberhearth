# [Mayor Kempthorne](mayor-kempthorne.md)

Mayor Kempthorne is the mayor of Timberhearth.

One autumn evening, Vendraxis sent a sneaky attack on Timberhearth with his Creeping Wither pumpkins. These mischievous pumpkins rolled into town, trying to take over the streets and scare the villagers. Jessica Willowglen and her son Gabriel Thatcher, along with Gabriel's brave dog Poodler, quickly teamed up to stop the pumpkins. Gabriel threw his magical slingshot while Jessica used her clever spells, and Poodler barked loudly, scaring the pumpkins away one by one.

Despite their best efforts, the town fountain, a favorite spot for everyone, was sadly broken by the pumpkins during the battle. But thanks to Jessica, Gabriel, and Poodler’s teamwork, the rest of Timberhearth stayed safe. The villagers cheered for the brave family who helped protect their home from the Creeping Wither pumpkins.
